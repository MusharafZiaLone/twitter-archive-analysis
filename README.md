twitter-archive-analysis
========================

Some tools to help analyze the twitter archive.

Take a look at the requirements.txt file to look at the libraries I used. Note that I'm barely using the NLTK library now so you should be able to comment out where it's used without affecting too much of the code.

You can run the script like so: python analyze.py --dir="/Users/dangoldin/Downloads/tweets"
