        <h3>Visualizing my Twitter Archive</h3>

<p>So: I've been really interested in data mining and natural language analysis lately. I've set up <a href="https://github.com/laurenarcher/TweetMines">tweet mining on linode using MongoDB</a> and that's gathering data as we speak, but in the meantime I wanted to get started with something a bit simpler.</p>

<p>I figure the best place to start analyzing Twitter data is with my own Twitter Archive. More information on finding and downloading your Twitter Archive can be found <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>After a short search around github I found <a href="https://github.com/dangoldin/twitter-archive-analysis">Dangoldin's</a> <strong>twitter-archive-analysis</strong>, which already did a lot of the things I was interested in, and also seemed like good introduction to some of the python data analysis tools I've been reading about lately, including <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, and <a href="http://nltk.org/">nltk</a>.</p>

<p>I've made a few adjustments to his code. This is the first time I've ever forked a repo on github, so I'm open to feedback. I think I've made it easier for people of all OS's and experience levels to use. I've also added word cloud visualization with <a href="https://github.com/atizo/PyTagCloud">PyTagCloud</a>.</p>

<p>Now onto the results!</p>

<h3>MatPlotLib</h3>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/by-month.png" alt="Tweets by Month"></p>

<p>Here are all of the tweets I've ever made distributed over time by month. It looks like I used to tweet a lot more in 2009-2010, which I will now call 'peak tweet'.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/by-dow.png" alt="Day of Week"></p>

<p>I wouldn't have guessed that I tend the tweet the most on hump day, but it looks like I do more tweeting on Wednesday than I do on any other day of the week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/">This </a>Twitter-wide analysis shows Tuesday, followed by Wednesday as the most popular days to tweet. (Although I've seen variations on this chart that shows Thursday and Friday as the most popular.)</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/by-hour.png" alt="By Hour"></p>

<p>I also tend to tweet in the late morning and afternoon, fairly <a href="http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/">typical</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/by-month-type-stacked.png" alt="By Type of Tweet"></p>

<p>This chart stacks the type of tweet by month. At first glance, it looks like I am a lot less original and a lot more social now than I was in 2009. While that may be true, Twitter didn't <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.twitter.com%2F2009%2F08%2Fproject-retweet-phase-one.html&amp;ei=cp9lUezHEs-GyQHJ7oGoBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEH16dZzo_CayjJ3SP-wSOBamKFCg&amp;sig2=B3gWXTr-RostEU4o3nnoIA&amp;bvm=bv.44990110,d.aWc">formalize RTs</a> until the end of 2009, which probably accounts for the bloated original tweet count before then.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/by-month-dow.png" alt="Day of Week, Month, Year"></p>

<p>Here we see 'peak tweet' again, sometime between September 2009 and February 2010. I remember Twitter being a major creative outlet for me at the time. I've since found more creative outlets than I know what to do with. </p>

<h3>PyTagCloud</h3>

<p>Now onto everyone's favourite type of text visualization: Word clouds!</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/c_most_common.png" alt="Most Common Tweet Words"></p>

<p>Here are the words I use most often when I tweet. I talk about heritage, Toronto and outer space.</p>

<p>I also <em>like</em> a lot of things.</p>

<p>PyTagCloud uses a fairly basic list of stopwords that it omits from word counts. I added internet-specific stopwords like <strong>www</strong> and <strong>http</strong> to the PyTagCloud <em>english</em> stopwords list and so can you!</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/at_c_most_common.png" alt="Most Common @replies"></p>

<p>Here are the people I talk at the most.</p>

<p>I played around with the built-in PyTagCloud colour scheme and font options a lot. </p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50961844/hash_c_most_common.png" alt="Most Common #hashtags"></p>

<p>And here are the hashtags I've used the most. I mostly see hashtags as gimmicky or event-related. <strong>#builtheritage</strong> is the hashtag used for a monthly twitter chat on the subject, so I use it regularly.</p>

<h3>Feedback is always appreciated.</h3>

<p>I am a rookie and forever learning. If I've gotten something completely wrong I'd love it if you could send some constructive criticism my way.</p>
