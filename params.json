{"name":"Twitter Archive Analysis","tagline":"Using python to analyze and visualize your twitter archive.","body":"### Visualizing my Twitter Archive\r\n\r\nSo: I've been really interested in data mining and natural language analysis lately. I've set up [tweet mining on linode using MongoDB](https://github.com/laurenarcher/TweetMines) and that's gathering data as we speak, but in the meantime I wanted to get started with something a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nI figure the best place to start analyzing Twitter data is with my own Twitter Archive. More information on finding and downloading your Twitter Archive can be found [here](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html).\r\n\r\nAfter a short search around github I found [Dangoldin's](https://github.com/dangoldin/twitter-archive-analysis) **twitter-archive-analysis**, which already did a lot of the things I was interested in, and also seemed like good introduction to some of the python data analysis tools I've been reading about lately, including [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and [nltk](http://nltk.org/).\r\n\r\nI've made a few adjustments to his code. This is the first time I've ever forked a repo on github, so I'm open to feedback. I think I've made it easier for people of all OS's and experience levels to use. I've also added word cloud visualization with [PyTagCloud](https://github.com/atizo/PyTagCloud).\r\n\r\nNow onto the results!\r\n\r\n### MatPlotLib\r\n\r\n![Tweets by Month](https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/0/AADCn1lvfCmB1ag-U-kjCT5zanOMVmSCdW8tsxw7apzcQA/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/by-month.png/o7jKB8S7nx6K4lrOca4EDXzFll2umAxVGly6zH7ny_s?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nHere are all of the tweets I've ever made distributed over time by month. It looks like I used to tweet a lot more in 2009-2010, which I will now call 'peak tweet'.\r\n\r\n![Day of Week](https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/0/AABj3r0bJHXt83f5UnLHBu67CTZnquyj0AZuIVQp_Up1zg/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/by-dow.png/rHw_MUSoGf2JVRS5qs3BJ2ffv9U3QkeFZCoiaoOIZvE?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have guessed that I tend the tweet the most on hump day, but it looks like I do more tweeting on Wednesday than I do on any other day of the week.\r\n\r\n[This ](http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/)Twitter-wide analysis shows Tuesday, followed by Wednesday as the most popular days to tweet. (Although I've seen variations on this chart that shows Thursday and Friday as the most popular.)\r\n\r\n![By Hour](https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/0/AAAYZJ08GUzbdkoCCMK3OIHXfWVwB01awS7-d__O19vHzg/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/by-hour.png/XNfjBWRpQYfN8vVra1NjEYQFXmyAeyke15Ljjs5ZuK8?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nI also tend to tweet in the late morning and afternoon, fairly [typical](http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/).\r\n\r\n![By Type of Tweet](https://photos-2.dropbox.com/t/0/AAAL_eRNWuK_kPnc9GEO0_K4bPYwZGyc9-ZkmVmogZwAQw/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/by-month-type-stacked.png/C8UsdmqWr0Ie52wQg-g6IW8Vx0UGiUNt4AdyKiHECJ8?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nThis chart stacks the type of tweet by month. At first glance, it looks like I am a lot less original and a lot more social now than I was in 2009. While that may be true, Twitter didn't [formalize RTs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.twitter.com%2F2009%2F08%2Fproject-retweet-phase-one.html&ei=cp9lUezHEs-GyQHJ7oGoBg&usg=AFQjCNEH16dZzo_CayjJ3SP-wSOBamKFCg&sig2=B3gWXTr-RostEU4o3nnoIA&bvm=bv.44990110,d.aWc) until the end of 2009, which probably accounts for the bloated original tweet count before then.\r\n\r\n![Day of Week, Month, Year](https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/0/AAAeKejRGBnNQBMgxpakomYV_rKIuGTy8NokikUBQfNRBQ/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/by-month-dow.png/zCUokmlcn4u9VX1TocU9MHeTOKzLrrRbTHjC1MUYaTE?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nHere we see 'peak tweet' again, sometime between September 2009 and February 2010. I remember Twitter being a major creative outlet for me at the time. I've since found more creative outlets than I know what to do with. \r\n\r\n### PyTagCloud\r\n\r\nNow onto everyone's favourite type of text visualization: Word clouds!\r\n\r\n![Most Common Tweet Words](https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/0/AAAVqS9tt0blyVocADjJCDZq_cEiYlgX4Zs0QRYNCLDSlw/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/c_most_common.png/iUl_uNxI_dB9w_KbUuEGLJX5RAvjNp5RGZBAKDHGI1o?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nHere are the words I use most often when I tweet. I talk about heritage, Toronto and outer space.\r\n\r\nI also _like_ a lot of things.\r\n \r\nPyTagCloud uses a fairly basic list of stopwords that it omits from word counts. I added internet-specific stopwords like **www** and **http** to the PyTagCloud _english_ stopwords list and so can you!\r\n\r\n![Most Common @replies](https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/0/AAAsNisgcV3X1M8TWqII3kLLPsIuz01ycDTpNzWiJwGQcA/12/50961844/png/32x32/3/_/1/2/at_c_most_common.png/1Y2eN0l9gTtBGugQ2Jyaq2CXj44bBTDxC9tY9haeF_g?size=1280x960)\r\n\r\nHere are the people I talk at the most.\r\n\r\nI played around with the built-in PyTagCloud colour scheme and font options a lot. \r\n\r\n![Most Common #hashtags](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mmas0mvoituf5ye/at_c_most_common.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here are the hashtags I've used the most. I mostly see hashtags as gimmicky or event-related. **#builtheritage** is the hashtag used for a monthly twitter chat on the subject, so I use it regularly.\r\n\r\n### Feedback is always appreciated.\r\n\r\nI am a rookie and forever learning. If I've gotten something completely wrong I'd love it if you could send some constructive criticism my way.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
